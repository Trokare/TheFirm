Introducing a new industrial lawless faction : the Firm

The Firm is a interplanetary conglomerate of free minded entrepreneurs ready to take the risks inherent to setting their sight on lawless Rimworlds in the hope of earning matching profits.

The Firm is specialised in providing sub-contractors and consultants, selling medical and recreation medicine treatments as well as providing settlements with high quality and reliability security equipments.

[Author's word :]
This is a mod I made for fun and to learn modding, trying to create an industrial/lawless faction with more character than the vanilla factions that are basically random and uninspired.

The Firm's pawns are hand picked to fit the theme : apparel, weapons, traits, bionics etc. etc.

As such, beware, they are more effective than raiders from vanilla : you won't find a god-like brawler/though/melee16 pawn armed only with a crappy bow.

You won't necessarily have to fight them : If you're an industrial/spacer faction, the Firm will consider you potential customers and send you traders, it's only if relationship degrade that you're going to be raided.

But if you're a tribal faction, they may send recruiters to invite you to join modern civilisation and become a productive member of society.

This mod also include :
- Integration with Vanilla Expended team's mods as it was inspired by the core apparel, weapon and armour modules.
- Several custom settlement map for the faction : weapon workshops, education facilities, headquarters of the firm etc. etc.
- Pawns hard to recruit and enslave because snitches get stitches, most of the time you're better of killing them outright or sending them back to the firm for goodwill.
- A trader and a trade ship because the Firm is all about sweet, sweet profits.
